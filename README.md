Unity 1 - GIMM 360 
Sound 1: There is a looping sound that plays on each enemy when they walk around the area. It is spatial and you can hear it better the closer they get to you.
Sound 2: There is an alarm sound that is triggered when a player steps in front of a security camera.
Sound 3: There is an ambient fan sound in the room in the far back right corner of the map. It can only be heard in this room.

I added reverb zones to every room on the final floor (the current floor I have made is the final floor before the boss room). I
added them in each room to make each room feel more intense with each step and make you be on your toes for enemies in the area.
